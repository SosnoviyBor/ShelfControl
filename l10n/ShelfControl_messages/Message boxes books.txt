---General---

(default) [Caius Cossades' words echo in your mind...]"There's a time and a place for everything, but not now."

The book is heavy in your hands and you remember: all knowledge in Morrowind has a price, and you have not paid for this yet.

A spark lights your curiosity as you open the cover to read, but the Merchant's eyes remind you: every word in this land comes with a price.

You imagine the secrets this tome/book holds, but even desire is powerless here. The book/tome's knowledge cannot be received without coin.

When you touch the cover of the book, the Merchant shakes their head and says, "The books are not for browsing, outlander. Pay, and then you may read."

The nearby Bookseller scolds you. "Outlander, if you have the gold, the book is yours." Until you pay, the pages will remain shut.

This book is not for idle eyes. You must pay before you can read it.

"I sell knowledge, not favors," the nearby Bookseller says. "Settle the matter of coin and the book is yours to read."

Every book here has its price in gold. Without paying, the cover will remain firmly shut.

The bookseller glares at you in disapproval. "If you wish to look through that volume, you must first pay."

The book/tome seems to resist your hand. Until it is purchased, its knowledge remains closed to you.

The book feels heavy in your hands. To open it without paying would draw the Merchant’s unwanted attention.

You run a finger along the spine, but feel the eyes of the seller on your back. Best not to read before purchasing.

The bookseller watches closely, and you know the book will remain closed until your coinpurse is lighter.

"Not before buying!" the Merchant shouts, and you withdraw your hand from the cover.

You feel the vendor's presence over your shoulders. Until you exchange coin, the book cover will stay shut.

You trace the cover of this book with your fingers, but it  remains closed until it is paid for.

You sense the merchant’s gaze. To read without purchase would invite trouble.

You sense the merchant's disapproval before a word is spoken. The book remains closed, and so must your curiosity, until it is bought.

In the quiet of the shop, you remind yourself: the price of knowledge is not measured in desire, but in coin.

The book/tome hums with hidden knowledge, yet you resist. To open it now would be to invite the merchant’s ire. Best to pay first.

A nearby note bears a stern warning: "Any who open this book before settling its price shall answer to the seller and the guards."

A worn inscription on the wall reads: "Respect the tome, respect the trade. Do not read without purchase."

---Location---

A neatly inked notice is affixed to the shelf: "Browsing without purchase is forbidden. Offenders will be reported to the Ordinators."

The city dazzles, the merchants intimidate, and the pages remain stubborn and shut. The book is closed until you pay.

The air is thick with incense and dust. You hover at the edge of discovery, but the shopkeeper’s eyes remind you: this knowledge is not yet yours.

Next to the book, there is a scribbled note: "Coin is key. Without it, the pages remain shut."

An old note is tucked between the stacks: "Theft of knowledge is theft all the same. Payment is the path to  wisdom."

A warning is pinned below the book: "DELICATE. Spine breaks easily. Browsers pay for damages."

A written warning next to the book carries a harsh scrawl: "Outlanders pay if caught prying."

--Jobasha's Rare Books--

Jobasha says, "A fair price for rare words, friend."

An note written in faded ink falls out of the cover: "Inventory of Jobasha. Unauthorized reading prohibited."

---Racial Variants---


--From Khajiit vendor--

"This one has books if you have coin. No coin, no books," you hear from over the counter. 

As you touch the book cover, the Bookseller growls. "Your kind is not to be trusted. Pay, or leave the book shut."

"No free treats," the Trader hisses. "Coin opens the pages, yes?"

--For Khajiit player--

The seller sneers at you from over the counter. "Not for your hands, beast. Coin first, if you even have it."

You sense the merchant’s disapproval before a word is spoken. Best to pay first.

--Dunmer--

“We are not in the habit of lending knowledge freely, outlander," the nearby Merchant says. "Pay, and you may read."

The Trader looks at you with disapproval, "You wouldn’t drink sujamma from a f'lah's cup without paying, so why read my book before buying?’”

--Dunmer (to outlander)--

The Bookseller narrows their eyes as you browse the books. "Do you take us for fools, outlander? Pay for what you would read."

“Do you think yourself entitled, outlander? Pay, or get out," you hear when you try to open this book.

--Imperial Vendor/player--

"East Empire Trading Company Regulations are clear: no reading until the book is purchased," the Bookseller reminds you.

--Nord Vendor/player--

"If you’ve coin, buy. If not, keep your hands off," the Trader scowls.
No reading unless you've bought it. This isn't a Mead Hall.

--Altmer Vendor/player--

"Do you think knowledge is free, outlander? Hardly." The Bookseller scoffs.
Even the finest mind must respect the cost of knowledge. This book is not yours to take without proper payment.
