buyable_generic_2: "A spark lights your curiosity as you open the cover to read, but the Merchant's eyes remind you: every word in this land comes with a price."
buyable_generic_3: "You imagine the secrets this tome/book holds, but even desire is powerless here. The book's knowledge cannot be received without coin."
buyable_generic_4: "When you touch the cover of the book, the Merchant shakes their head and says, \"The books are not for browsing, outlander. Pay, and then you may read.\""
buyable_generic_5: "The nearby Bookseller scolds you. \"Outlander, if you have the gold, the book is yours.\" Until you pay, the pages will remain shut."
buyable_generic_6: "This book is not for idle eyes. You must pay before you can read it."
buyable_generic_7: "\"I sell knowledge, not favors,\" the nearby Bookseller says. \"Settle the matter of coin and the book is yours to read.\""

buyable_generic_17: "You sense the merchant’s gaze. To read without purchase would invite trouble."
buyable_generic_18: "You sense the merchant's disapproval before a word is spoken. The book remains closed, and so must your curiosity, until it is bought."
buyable_generic_19: "In the quiet of the shop, you remind yourself: the price of knowledge is not measured in desire, but in coin."
buyable_generic_20: "The book hums with hidden knowledge, yet you resist. To open it now would be to invite the merchant’s ire. Best to pay first."

buyable_faction_owner_reoran_4: "\"In Redoran land, property is respected,\" the Bookseller says. \"Lay down your coin, and then you can read.\""

buyable_faction_owner_telvanni_1: "As you open the cover, the Telvanni trader sneers. “My books are not yours to plunder. Pay, or begone. Power is never free.”"

buyable_faction_player_hlaalu_1: "\"Coin first, read after. That is the way of trade, outlander. Surely one of our own knows better,\" the Hlaalu merchant says."
