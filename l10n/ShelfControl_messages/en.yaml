buyable_faction_owner_reoran_3: "Under Redoran law, what is not yet yours may not yet be taken. Even books, it seems."
buyable_faction_owner_reoran_4: '"In Redoran land, property is respected," the Bookseller says. "Lay down your coin, and then you can read."'

buyable_faction_owner_telvanni_1: "As you open the cover, the Telvanni trader sneers. “My books are not yours to plunder. Pay, or begone. Power is never free.”"
buyable_faction_owner_telvanni_2: "“If you cannot afford a book, what business have you with knowledge at all?”"
buyable_faction_owner_telvanni_3: '"Do you believe wisdom should be given to you freely, like Temple bread to the poor? How quaint."'

buyable_faction_player_redoran_1: "You want to read the book in front of you, but discipline says that curiosity is earned, not taken."
buyable_faction_player_redoran_2: "To read without paying would feel like dishonor, a breach of Redoran discipline."
buyable_faction_player_redoran_3: '"To read without paying is to act without discipline and unworthy of House Redoran," the bookseller says.'
